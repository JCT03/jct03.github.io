---
My name is Jacob Collier-Tenison (he/him), and I am from Little Rock, Arkansas. Currently, I am a student at Hendrix College, where I am pursuing a bacholer of arts in computer science, with a minor in physics. I am most interested in the topics of robotics and artificial intelligence. Outside of my studies, I am a goalkeeper on the Hendrix soccer team and a resident assistant in the Miller Creative Quad.
