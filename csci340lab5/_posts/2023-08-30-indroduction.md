My setup experiance for this blog was, overall, very positive. The first lab was the first time that I had done anything related to creating a website, so almost everything was new to me. Of course, by the time I started working with Jekyll, I did have some basic experiance with html. Still, the process that Jekyll follows was completely new to me. 

The installation method was also a little new for me. I have installed things using the command line once or twice before, but it is not something that I would say I am experienced with. That led to some trouble with installing everything based on the [lab instructions][lab-instructions]. In particular, the bundle install command in step 4 was throwing an error. However, Professor Goadrich directed me to use the sudo command in front and it worked. I honestly have no idea how it worked, but I am glad it did. 

I think that I have a pretty good idea of how everything works. Jekyll has essentially created their own, simple format that the program converts into HTML at run-time. So far, I have seen a lot of benefits to Jekyll:
- Jekyll takes care of all of the basic formatting for you
- Jekyll applies unform colors and themes to all of your pages
- Jekyll has different layouts that you can use
- Jekyll easily links your social media

I am sure there is a lot more that Jekyll can do. I have looked at [examples][examples] and am excited to explore the different formatting features and customization that it offers. Overall, I would say that it has been a very intuitive and stress-free experiance.
